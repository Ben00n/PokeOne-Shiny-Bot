How to use?
1) Run either LR(left right) or NormalScript(up down) - for movement scripts.
2) Run RandomMouseMovement script.
3) Toggle both of the scripts.

When a shiny is found the bot stops and plays music.

#You need to download AHK if you don't have it in order to run it as the scripts are NOT compiled.
#This bot will never be detected by their lOOp anticheat system due to the fact their system is not able to detect 2 scripts at the same time.
