# PokeOne-Shiny-Bot
A bot for a game called PokeOne.
20/10/2021 - gone open source.

How to use?
1) Run either LR(left right) or NormalScript(up down) - for movement scripts.
2) Run RandomMouseMovement script.
3) Toggle both of the scripts.

When a shiny is found the bot stops and plays music.

#You need to download AHK if you don't have it in order to run it as the scripts are NOT compiled.

#This bot will never be detected by their lOOp anticheat system due to the fact their system is not able to detect 2 scripts controlling mouse & keyboard at the same time.
